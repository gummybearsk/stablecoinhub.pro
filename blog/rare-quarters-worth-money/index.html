                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">❓ How do I know if my coin is valuable?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Check the date, mint mark, and condition. Rare dates, low mintages, and errors increase value. Professional grading provides accurate assessment.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">❓ Should I clean my old coins?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Never clean coins! Cleaning destroys the natural patina and can reduce value by 50-90%. Leave coins in their natural state for maximum value.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">❓ Where can I sell valuable coins?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Options include local coin dealers, online marketplaces like eBay, auction houses like Heritage Auctions, and coin shows. Get multiple appraisals before selling.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">❓ Is coin collecting a good investment?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Rare coins can appreciate significantly, but the market is specialized. Focus on quality over quantity and buy from reputable dealers.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">❓ What's the difference between numismatic and bullion value?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Numismatic value is based on rarity and collector demand. Bullion value is based on metal content. Rare coins often trade far above bullion value.</div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The stablecoin ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges for participants. Whether you're interested in earning yield, facilitating international transfers, or simply seeking a stable store of value in the crypto ecosystem, understanding the nuances of different stablecoins and platforms is essential.</p>

                <p>As we move through 2025, regulatory clarity, technological innovation, and institutional adoption will continue shaping the landscape. Staying informed about developments, maintaining proper risk management, and choosing platforms aligned with your goals will be key to success.</p>

                <p>Remember that while stablecoins offer relative stability compared to other cryptocurrencies, they still carry risks. Always conduct thorough research, start with small amounts, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The combination of traditional finance principles and blockchain innovation creates exciting possibilities, but prudent approach remains essential.</p>
